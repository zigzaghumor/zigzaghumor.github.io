## About Me

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Warwick, studying at the Department of Economics. Prior to coming to the UK, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, China. 

Alongside my academic pursuits, I possess a deep interest in computer technology and consider myself extremely tech-savvy. I particularly enjoy utilizing open-source software and possess a certain level of experience in using Linux. Additionally, my hobbies include rock music, science fiction, philosophy, and independent films.
